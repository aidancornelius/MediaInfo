# MediaInfo (Signed)

Signed and notarized builds of [sbarex/MediaInfo](https://github.com/sbarex/MediaInfo).

The original project doesn't code sign their releases, which causes macOS Gatekeeper warnings. This repo automatically downloads upstream releases, signs them with a valid Developer ID certificate, and notarizes them with Apple.
